NLP Overview: AI text detection

you first need to download the data from the following link
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset/data?select=train_v2_drcat_02.csv
 
dataloader: loads the date from kaggle.

part1: training with SVM and Random Forest models after TF-IDF vectorization.
- estimated running time: 15m

part2: training with LSTM with FastText vectorization. Download wiki-news-300d-1M.vec from this link: https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html and put in the parent directly of the cloned directory to run part2 from scratch.
- estimated running time: 30m
  
part3: BERT(Transformer) with Catboost vectorization.
- estimated running time:1h
